## Installation

To set up JMMN x SHAW locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jummon-koshai/jmmnshaw.git
   cd jmmnshaw
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   The project relies on external libraries served via CDNs (e.g., GSAP, Quill.js, Pusher). No local installation of dependencies is required, but ensure you have a stable internet connection for CDN access.

3. **Set Up a Local Server**:
   Since this is a static HTML project, serve it using a local development server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Or use any other local server tool like `live-server`:
   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   live-server
   ```

4. **Configure Pusher**:
   - Sign up at [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) and create a new app.
   - Update the Pusher configuration in the `<script>` section with your app credentials:
     ```javascript
     const pusher = new Pusher('YOUR_APP_KEY', { cluster: 'YOUR_CLUSTER' });
     ```

5. **Optional: Configure Netlify Functions**:
   - For real-time chat persistence, deploy the project on Netlify and set up serverless functions (`/.netlify/functions/get-messages` and `/.netlify/functions/save-message`) to integrate with a Neon database or similar.
   - Refer to [Netlify Functions Documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) for setup details.

6. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by your server).
